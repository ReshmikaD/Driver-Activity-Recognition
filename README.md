# Driver-Activity-Recognition  

This model focuses on driver distraction activities via images of the driver using different kinds of machine learning and deep learning techniques.  

# Introduction  

Distraction during driving is one of the main factor that causes severe car accidents. Survey reveals that different activities of the driver have different risks of causing accident. Therefore, an activity recognition model that alerts the driver incase of distraction is essential.

# Models Used  

1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier** - Mean Accuracy: 0.550700  

2. **Decision Tree Classifier** - Mean Accuracy: 0.845420  

3. **CNN Model** - Test Accuracy: 99.176% (overfitting)  

4. **CNN with dropouts** - Test Accuracy: 94.337%            

# Future Scope   

Results of this project may be used for further research and applied to as a part of an on-car monitoring system where the machine will decide to take-over control of the car if the driver is distracted and poses a potential accident. Additionally, For further improvement of these models, we could apply more sophisticated weight initialization methods or semi-supervised learning methods. We could also try out some existing packages of more complex CNN-based models like ResNet or VGG.
